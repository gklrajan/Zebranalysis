# Zebranalysis

Analysis pipeline for animal swimming parameters obtained from the MBD program.
Started on 2017-08-11.

A sample bin file is provided: 2017_10_001 contains frame#, cameraTime, xy coords and fishAngle. BinReader.m can be used to read all these parameters from the bin file and save them to a csv file. 

freeswim_pipeline will be the first analysis project looking at the swimming kinematics of the fish.
